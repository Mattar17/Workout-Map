# Workout Map
- Workout map is a simple website written in pure HTML,CSS and Javascript as on of many projects in Jonas Shmedetmann Javascript course

- I've learned a lot through out this project:
1. Javascript Classes ,Inheritance and prototype chaining
2. Integrating with third party libararies like leaflet in this case
3. Localstorage API usage
4. Deploying Projects using netlify and github
